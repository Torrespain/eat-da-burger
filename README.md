# eat-da-burger

<h3>Description</h3>

This Restaurant app is a Burger Logger that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM.
The app lets the user input the names of the burgers they want to eat and will be stored on the left column ready to be eaten.

Once the user clicks the devour button, the burger will be "eaten by moving to the right column".

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
